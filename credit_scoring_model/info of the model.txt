F1-Score:
Class 0: 0.96
Class 1: 0.82
Analysis and Recommendations
Class Imbalance:

The model shows a significant imbalance in precision and recall between the classes. Class 0 (presumably "no default") has much higher recall compared to Class 1 ("default").
Although precision for Class 1 is high, the recall is lower, indicating that the model is missing a substantial number of positive cases (defaults).
Confusion Matrix Insights:

The model is very good at identifying non-defaulters (high TN and low FP).
However, it is not as effective in identifying defaulters (relatively high FN), which can be critical in a credit scoring context as identifying defaulters accurately is crucial for financial institutions.
Improvements
Handle Class Imbalance:

Resampling Techniques: Apply techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset.
Class Weights: Adjust the class weights in the Random Forest model to give more importance to the minority class.
Feature Engineering:

Explore additional features or transformations that might help the model learn better distinctions between defaulters and non-defaulters.
Model Tuning:

Perform hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search or Random Search to find the optimal parameters for the Random Forest model.
Try Different Algorithms:

Experiment with other algorithms like Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, or even neural networks to see if they offer improved performance.
